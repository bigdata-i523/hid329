        While the collection of vast amounts of data in the world of
        higher education has occurred for decades, the use of big data
        applications and analytics is fairly new to this
        environment. There is a need to understand how the use of big
        data analytics can help institutions determine student
        behavior as well as stay relevant in a digital and evolving
        age of technological advances, tools, and skills. The higher
        education space is changing as the population of students
        going to college is on the decline which increases competition
        and the need for institutions to be more strategic in their
        efforts for attracting students to their institutions. We will
        explore at a very high level how higher education could
        utilize big data analytics to inform marketing initiatives in
        recruiting and enrolling students as well as what potential
        challenges and considerations could impact this process.

        The collection, analysis, and dissemination of findings from big data can provide benefits to society across a variety of industries including health care, education, law enforcement, and commercial retailers, to name a few. However, with benefits, also comes caveats, risks, and even significant harm when this process of harnessing big data does not go as planned. One prominent discussion point around the use of big data is around privacy. In today's age of sharing information, can one really expect privacy given all the methods in which they can share information? What impact can data breaches have on a person's (or company's) personal information, security, and livelihood? While there are techniques and tools that have been implemented to help minimize the risk, is a data breach more a matter of if it occurs or more so when occurs? We will seek to address these questions as we explore how the increasing and ever changing space of online behavior, data mining, and big data analytics affects today's experience with maintaining privacy.

        A customer’s journey consists of multiple touch points along
        the way as they make choices and ultimately, purchasing
        decisions. Real-time recommendations, personalized marketing
        messages, and geo-targeted advertising can all play a role in
        ‘nudging’ the consumer appropriately when companies are
        looking to drive consumer interaction and behavior. This paper
        will evaluate how companies have used these technique to
        influence the customer decision journey with the use of big
        data, customer relationship management tools, and predictive
        analytics.
