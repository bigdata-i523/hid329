        While the collection of vast amounts of data in the world of
        higher education has occurred for decades, the use of big data
        applications and analytics is fairly new to this
        environment. There is a need to understand how the use of big
        data analytics can help institutions determine student
        behavior as well as stay relevant in a digital and evolving
        age of technological advances, tools, and skills. The higher
        education space is changing as the population of students
        going to college is on the decline which increases competition
        and the need for institutions to be more strategic in their
        efforts for attracting students to their institutions. We will
        explore at a very high level how higher education could
        utilize big data analytics to inform marketing initiatives in
        recruiting and enrolling students as well as what potential
        challenges and considerations could impact this process.

        This paper will explore issues around the use of big data
        analytics and mining as it relates to user privacy. Specific
        areas addressed include the level of control/say an average
        user has in how their data is used and/or shared along with
        the implications when significant data breaches occur.

        A customer’s journey consists of multiple touch points along
        the way as they make choices and ultimately, purchasing
        decisions. Real-time recommendations, personalized marketing
        messages, and geo-targeted advertising can all play a role in
        ‘nudging’ the consumer appropriately when companies are
        looking to drive consumer interaction and behavior. This paper
        will evaluate how companies have used these technique to
        influence the customer decision journey with the use of big
        data, customer relationship management tools, and predictive
        analytics.
